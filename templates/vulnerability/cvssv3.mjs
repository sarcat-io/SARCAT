Base Score Metrics
The Base metric group represents the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments. It is composed of two sets of metrics: the Exploitability metrics and the Impact metrics. The Exploitability metrics reflect the ease and technical means by which the vulnerability can be exploited. That is, they represent characteristics of the thing that is vulnerable, which we refer to formally as the vulnerable component. On the other hand, the Impact metrics reflect the direct consequence of a successful exploit, and represent the consequence to the thing that suffers the impact, which we refer to formally as the impacted component.
Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector (AV)*
Attack Complexity (AC)*
Privileges Required (PR)*
User Interaction (UI)*
Scope (S)*
Impact Metrics
Confidentiality Impact (C)*
Integrity Impact (I)*
Availability Impact (A)*
* - All base metrics are required to generate a base score.

CVSS v3.1 Equations
The CVSS v3.1 equations are defined below.

Base
The Base Score is a function of the Impact and Exploitability sub score equations. Where the Base score is defined as,

    If (Impact sub score <= 0)     0 else,
    Scope Unchanged4                 𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑝(𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚[(𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡 + 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦), 10])
    Scope Changed                      𝑅𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑢𝑝(𝑀𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚[1.08 × (𝐼𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡 + 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦), 10])

and the Impact sub score (ISC) is defined as,

    Scope Unchanged 6.42 × 𝐼𝑆𝐶Base
    Scope Changed 7.52 × [𝐼𝑆𝐶𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒 − 0.029] − 3.25 × [𝐼𝑆𝐶𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒 − 0.02]15
